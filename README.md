# Scrape Automate behind Password Protected Apps with Selenium Python

![Project Image](project_image.jpg)

This project provides a solution for scraping and automating tasks behind password-protected applications using Selenium and Python. It allows you to programmatically interact with web applications that require authentication, enabling you to extract data, perform actions, and automate tasks.

## Features

- **Login Automation**: Automate the login process to access password-protected applications.
- **Web Scraping**: Extract data from web pages by navigating through the application using Selenium.
- **Task Automation**: Automate repetitive tasks and actions on password-protected apps.
- **Headless Mode**: Run the automation process in headless mode to perform tasks in the background.
- **Customizable**: Easily adapt the code to fit the requirements of your specific application.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Selenium
- WebDriver (Chrome or Firefox)
- Web browser login credentials

## Installation

1. Clone or download the project to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install selenium`.
3. Download the appropriate WebDriver for your browser (Chrome or Firefox) and ensure it is in your system's PATH.
4. Update the `config.py` file with the necessary information, including the URL of the password-protected app, login credentials, and other relevant settings.
5. Run the `main.py` script to start the automation process.

## Usage

1. Update the `config.py` file with the required information.
2. Customize the automation tasks in the `main.py` script according to your specific needs.
3. Run the `main.py` script to execute the automation process.
4. Monitor the script execution for any errors or exceptions.
5. Analyze the extracted data or check the completion of the automated tasks.

## Limitations

- This project is intended for educational and personal use only. Make sure to comply with the terms of service and legal requirements of the targeted application.
- The code provided may require modification based on the specific structure and behavior of the password-protected application you are targeting.
- Websites or applications with complex authentication mechanisms (such as multi-factor authentication or CAPTCHAs) may require additional code customization or alternative solutions.
